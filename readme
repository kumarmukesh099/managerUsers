You can run the code using - npm run server



Note :-

 I can use import instead of require because import is an ES6 part and 
 if we want to require/import json file then we need to pass --experimental-json-modules while running server or 
 need to add it in the script and in ES6 Importing JSON modules is an experimental feature  in Es6. This feature could change at any time
 that's why i used require instead of import.
