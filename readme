You can run the code using - npm run server


This project will allow you to - 
- Create a new User

- Update an Existing User

- Delete an User

- Get all Users

--- Get the limited users

--- Get all Users sorted by createdOn timestamp with Pagination //you can add default limit per page in code or can pass limit in params 

--- Get all Users sorted by their distance from coordinates passed in the query param of the Endpoint. 

For Example. There's an API call to get all users sorted by distance from [17.3850, 78.4867] coordinates.




Note :-

 I can use import instead of require because import is an ES6 part and 
 if we want to require/import json file then we need to pass --experimental-json-modules while running server or 
 need to add it in the script and in ES6 Importing JSON modules is an experimental feature  in Es6. This feature could change at any time
 that's why i used require instead of import.
